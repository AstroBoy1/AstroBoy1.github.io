I've been involved with chess for a while and am happy to share my first research paper in my program
on estimating chess ratings from moves. Of course there is the rating system from playing games based off
a player's current rating and an opponent's rating, but I was curious to see if it's possible to have a rating
independent of these, just by looking at moves and clock usage: [paper link][github-link]
